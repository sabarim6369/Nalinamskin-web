      "Best dermatology clinic in Salem! I was suffering from severe hair fall and was losing confidence. The doctor diagnosed the root cause and provided personalized hair treatment. After 3 months of treatment, I can see visible improvement in hair growth. The clinic maintains excellent hygiene standards and the consultation was very thorough.",

      "Excellent experience at Nalinam Clinic. I took my daughter for a skin allergy problem. The doctor was very gentle with her and explained everything clearly to us. The treatment worked wonderfully and her skin is now completely healed. They also treated my son's fever on the same visit - very convenient to have general consultation available. The clinic environment is calm and welcoming.",
